## How Data Analytics Drives Your Decisions

Data analytics uncovers hidden patterns in your sales, customer behavior, and operations. You identify top-performing products, optimize inventory, and predict demand shifts. Alchemetryx processes your CSV exports or database connections to generate visualizations and forecasts.

For example, analyze sales data with simple Python code:

<CodeGroup tabs="Python,R">
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')
monthly_sales = df.groupby('month')['revenue'].sum()
print(monthly_sales.head())
```
```r
library(dplyr)

sales <- read.csv('sales_data.csv')
monthly_sales <- sales %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(revenue = sum(revenue))
head(monthly_sales)
```
</CodeGroup>
